## Why

I have worked with databases for some years now. I made a lot of mistakes and a lot of dumb decisions in the past.
But probably just because no one told me that I was doing it wrong. To spare you a lot of time and prevent you from making the same mistakes I did, I created this page.

## Minecraft relation

Because most of the Java programmers can be found in the Minecraft community, the examples on this page are sometimes Minecraft related. I also encountered the most flawed code for database integration in this community. However the examples and advices given in this repository can be generally applied to all applications that are in need of a database integration.
