# Introduction / What can I expect.

Databases are often crucial when it comes to storing data.
This tutorial aims to get you ready to store your data in your MariaDB or MySQL database.

We will start with preparations and some general preconditions we need to clarify.
After this we will look into the DataSource and build our first database connection.
To continue with reading and writing data to the database, we will need to introduce some good practices. This will make
it easier for you to work with your database implementation.
After all of this, we can finally move to writing and reading some data and we'll do this with the example of a pretty simple coin
plugin, which gives and takes coins.

After reading this guide you will have basic knowledge on how to develop an application with a stable and good database
implementation.

Databases are a really large topic. We can't cover everything here. You might think this is much, but we are just
scraping the surface.
